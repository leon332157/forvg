        <i>Dear Victoria</i>:
            This is a small firework website that I made, hope you like it.

        First of all, I'm sorry for not telling you why I am scared of you, now here's the reason: I'm scared of embarrassment and rejections.
        Usually when I talk to you in person, there's always your friends or my friends around which makes me feel ok if I mess anything up. But if not,
        then it's like a situation where you need to make a presentation and you don't know what to talk about and you are just standing there when people
        are staring at you and you want to find some place to hide yourself. Personally, I think this is definitely a disadvantage when you are trying to
        be socialized. But for me, I can't help with this. Every time I see you I just want to hide myself. But there's just some unexplained force that
        drives me. And every time I mess up something, I will be so sad. And this just goes on over and over. Even if you and Audrey says that I'm not stupid,
        I believe I am, at least on a social level. I'm not a person that takes any compliments, so I'm very not used to it, I'm sorry for that. My whole life
        has been people making fun of me, to the point where I think that people saying good thing about me makes feel sad. So the result is me being so
        defensive on talking to people and making friends. Once in elementary school, I had a good friend who is in the same English class I go to on weekends.
        He once wanted to come to our home and play game with me, so I said ok. When my mom knows the happenings, she said never let anyone into your home
        with out talking to her. As I'm recalling this now, this seems pretty acceptable in ths US, but not very common in China, which is also one of the reason
        I don't visit my friends home. Recalling the time in middle school, which was also a boarding school where you live and eat in there. I was one of those
        kids that always break the rules, I once was told to stay at teacher's office to write reflections, even though I didn't know how I went through, it was a hard time.
        Here in the US, I am lucky enough to be in the public school system, and I'm lucky enough to meet you, Audrey and Preston, and many others who changed
        me in many ways. Especially you because the very for first time you are the girl I would write this to. There's a saying that "A person will always give their
        best face to other people they meet, and the worst thing are for their closet friends." I would totally agree with this. I never told anyone about how I think
        on things than just a few people. And even with that I feel unsafe, I will always make excuses to avoid about it. Which is what happen in most cases.
        But apparently this is not the way to go, so I had a thought about this, and I have to thank Audrey that encouraged me to make this. I'm just too sensitive when
        texting to someone that is very important to me, anything that might be a sign of rejection will upset me and makes me think about what I could've did wrong
        and how I would fix that. I still have to lot to learn from all of you, and I wish I could always be with you all. I will never able to explain how important
        these kind of experiences are to me. Thanks for being my best friend.

        Please make sure to keep this secret.

    Sincerely,
    Leon
